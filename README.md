## Background

The MOD music format, short for MODule, is a file format used to represent music tracks. It was originally developed for the Commodore Amiga computer system in the late 1980s. The format was widely used in the demoscene, a subculture focused on creating demos, which are non-interactive multimedia presentations.

The MOD format is based on the concept of 'samples'. These are small snippets of sound that can be played back at different pitches to create music. A MOD file contains a set of samples and a sequence of instructions for playing them, which allows for complex music tracks to be created and played back.

The format was revolutionary at the time because it allowed for the creation of complex, multi-channel music using relatively small amounts of data. This made it ideal for use in demos, which needed to be small enough to fit on a floppy disk.

The MOD format and the demoscene were closely linked, with many demo creators also creating their own music tracks. The format is still in use today, particularly in the chiptune music scene.
